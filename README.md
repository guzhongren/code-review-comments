- Make sure your project is a Git repository
- Comments persist across VS Code sessions

### Troubleshooting

**Comment not showing up?**
- Ensure you're in a Git repository
- Check that the file has been committed to Git
- Try refreshing the Diff Comments view

**Can't add comments?**
- Verify Git is installed and working
- Make sure the file is part of a Git repository
- Check that you have write permissions to the workspace

**Diff view not opening?**
- Ensure the referenced commits still exist
- Try refreshing the Git repository
- Check that Git extension is enabled

## Usage

### Adding Comments

1. **In Diff View**:
  - Open a diff view (e.g., from Git history, Source Control, or using `git diff`)
  - Right-click at the line where you want to add a comment
  - Select "Add Diff Comment" or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Add Diff Comment"

2. **In Regular Files**:
  - Open any file in a Git repository

  - The extension will automatically find the last commit that modified the file

### Viewing Comments

- Open the **Diff Comments** view in the Activity Bar
- Comments are displayed with file paths and commit information
- Format: `filename (parentHash → commitHash)` for diff comments
- Format: `filename (commitHash)` for single-commit comments

### Managing Comments

- **Edit**: Click the edit icon (✏️) next to any comment in the tree view
- **Delete**: Click the delete icon (🗑️) next to any comment

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `diff-comments.addComment`    | Add a new comment to the current file/diff       |

## Comment Storage Format

Comments are stored in `.vscode/diff-comments.yaml` with the following structure:

```yaml
- id: "unique-comment-id"
  text: "Your comment text"
  fileUri: "relative/path/to/file.ts"
  lineNumber: 42
  commitHash: "abc123def456"  # The commit being commented on
  parentHash: "def456abc123"  # The parent commit (for diff context)
```

### Fields Explanation

- **id**: Unique identifier for the comment
- **text**: The comment content
- **fileUri**: Relative path to the file within the workspace
- **lineNumber**: Zero-based line number where the comment was added
- **commitHash**: The commit hash that the comment refers to
- **parentHash**: The parent commit hash (used for creating proper diff views)
